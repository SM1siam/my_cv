## My First HTML CV  ([[[https://github.com/](https://github.com/](https://github.com/SM1siam/my_cv))](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv))

This is my first HTML project after learning the basics of HTML. It's a simple CV template you can customize with your information.

**Features:**

* Basic structure for a CV with sections for contact, skills, education, and experience.
* Uses placeholders for easy customization.
* Green text highlights section titles. 

**How to Use:**

1. Replace the placeholders with your own information:
    * Your Name
    * Contact details
    * Skills
    * Education details (School name, Location, Degree, Dates, Achievements)
    * Experience details (Company name, Location, Job title, Dates, Achievements, Skills gained)
    * Links to your online profiles

2. Save the file as `index.html`.

3. Open the file in a web browser to see your CV.

**Note:**

* This is a basic example using only HTML. You can further enhance it with CSS for styling and layout improvements.

**Further Learning:**

* Consider exploring CSS to add styles like fonts, colors, and layout.
* Learn about semantic HTML to improve the structure and meaning of your content.

I hope this helps you get started with creating your online CV!
